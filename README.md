# nameGenerator
PURPOSE:

Output a random first and last name, chosen independently from the French government's dataset.

POTENTIAL FIXES/UPDATES:

To make the first and last name coherent, we could further sort the dataset by name origin. 
First pick a completely random last name. Then based on chosen last name, choose a first name from same origin.

SOURCES:

Input set of first last names from: https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/liste-de-prenoms-et-patronymes/
